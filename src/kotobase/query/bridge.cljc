(ns kotobase.query.bridge
  "The kotobase-query bridge (ADR-2607172300 in `com-junkawasaki/root`) --
  materializes `kotobase.store/IStore` collections as datoms and runs
  Datomic-shaped `:find`/`:where` Datalog queries over them via
  `arrangement.datalog`.

  **Why this repo exists**: `kotobase.store`/`kotobase.local` (`IStore`) is
  a flat get/put/list(keys-in-one-collection)/append store -- no joins, no
  predicates across collections, no query language. `kotoba-lang/arrangement`
  is a 4-covering triple index (`spo`/`pso`/`pos`/`ocp` ≡ Datomic's
  EAVT/AEVT/AVET/VAET) with a real Datalog engine (`arrangement.datalog/q`)
  over it, but nothing wires `IStore` documents INTO that index. This
  namespace is that wiring -- a thin bridge, not a reimplementation:
  `arrangement.datalog` does all the actual query evaluation.

  **v0.1 scope / limitation, read before depending on this** -- linear
  materialization: `materialize` does a full `-list` + `-get` scan of every
  requested collection on every call, builds a throwaway in-memory
  `arrangement.core` db, and discards it. No incremental indexing, no
  caching, no persistence, no `arrangement.core/commit!` (the CID-addressed
  snapshot machinery is untouched -- this bridge never calls it). This is a
  deliberate, accepted v0.1 limitation (ADR-2607172300): fine for the small/
  test-scale query volume this bridge is built for right now; real
  incremental indexing via `arrangement`'s own index maintenance is a
  documented follow-up once there is real query-volume evidence, not a v0.1
  requirement.

  ## Doc -> datoms mapping

  For a document `doc` stored at `(-get store coll k)`:

  - the entity (`:s`) is `(keyword (str coll) (str k))` -- e.g. collection
    `\"users\"` key `\"u1\"` becomes the entity `:users/u1`. Globally unique
    across every materialized collection (no collision risk from bare keys
    repeating across collections), and human-readable in query results.
  - every entity ALWAYS gets two synthetic attributes so collection/key
    identity survives materialization and so cross-collection joins have
    something concrete to join ON: `:kotobase/coll` -> `(str coll)` and
    `:kotobase/key` -> `(str k)`. A doc in another collection that stores a
    foreign-key-shaped value (e.g. `{:dept-key \"d1\"}`) joins against the
    referenced entity via its `:kotobase/key` attribute -- see the worked
    join example below and in `test/kotobase/query/bridge_test.cljc`.
  - if `doc` is a map: every top-level `[attr v]` pair becomes a datom
    `{:s entity :p attr :o v}` -- `attr` is used AS-IS (whatever key shape
    the document actually used, typically a keyword; not coerced to a
    string). If `v` is itself a non-map collection (vector/set/list), it is
    treated as a Datomic-style cardinality-many attribute: one datom per
    element (`{:s entity :p attr :o el}` for each `el`), not one datom
    whose `:o` is the whole collection.
  - if `doc` is not a map (a bare scalar, or `nil`): one fallback datom
    `{:s entity :p :kotobase/value :o doc}`.
  - nested maps as attribute values are stored as an opaque `:o` value
    (not recursively flattened into their own entity) -- out of scope for
    v0.1, a documented limitation, not silently mishandled.

  ## Worked example

  ```clojure
  (require '[kotobase.local :as local]
           '[kotobase.store :as st]
           '[kotobase.query.bridge :as bridge])

  (def store (local/local-store))
  (st/-put store \"users\" \"u1\" {:name \"Alice\" :dept-key \"d1\"})
  (st/-put store \"departments\" \"d1\" {:name \"Engineering\"})

  (bridge/query store [\"users\" \"departments\"]
                '{:find [?uname ?dname]
                  :where [[?u :kotobase/coll \"users\"]
                          [?u :name ?uname]
                          [?u :dept-key ?dk]
                          [?d :kotobase/coll \"departments\"]
                          [?d :kotobase/key ?dk]
                          [?d :name ?dname]]}
                (constantly true))
  ;=> #{[\"Alice\" \"Engineering\"]}
  ```

  ## `visible?` is required, not defaulted

  Every query fn here takes `visible?` as a REQUIRED argument, the same
  discipline `arrangement.query`/`arrangement.datalog`/the retired `kqe`
  already enforce (ADR-2607050500, \"Query as first-class effect\" -- no
  permissive default to silently fall back on). Pass `(constantly true)` to
  see everything materialized -- that is a caller's explicit choice, never
  this bridge's default. `q`/`query` simply delegate arity to
  `arrangement.datalog/q`, which itself throws (arity error) if `visible?`
  is omitted -- there is no separate opt-out path to keep in sync.

  ## The supported contract is `materialize` + the access paths, NOT `q`

  ADR-2608039970 (`com-junkawasaki/root`). Datalog is ONE frontend over the
  materialized datom plane, not the IR every other query language has to be
  translated into. The datom plane (triple + content addressing) is what all
  the surfaces share; `q`'s `:find`/`:where` grammar is not.

  This was not a prediction. `org-w3-sparql-protocol` already uses
  `materialize` and never calls `q`, and says why in its own README: it has a
  complete SPARQL algebra of its own, so routing SPARQL through Datalog would
  mean translating one algebra into another and back for no benefit. That
  repo is on the SUPPORTED path, not off it. The same is true of any surface
  whose language does not sit comfortably on Datalog's set semantics -- SQL's
  bag semantics and ORDER BY, Cypher's variable-length paths.

  So the contract is:

  - `materialize` / `materialize-memo` / `db-for` -- `IStore` documents to
    one datom plane. Shared, and the thing every surface must go through.
  - `entity-id` -- the entity-naming convention, so a surface can address an
    entity by `[coll k]` without hard-coding the keyword shape.
  - `entity-attrs` / `by-predicate` / `by-predicate-value` / `refs-to` --
    the four covering indexes (spo/pso/pos/ocp, Datomic's EAVT/AEVT/AVET/VAET),
    each carrying `visible?`. A surface plans its own joins over these.
  - `q` / `query` -- the Datalog frontend. Still supported, still the right
    choice when the caller's language IS Datalog-shaped (`datomic-client-shim`).
    It is a peer of the surfaces that skip it, not their entry point.

  What a surface must NOT do is give up on the datom plane and keep its own
  physical representation of the same documents. What is shared is the plane
  (`materialize`), not the language (`q`) -- those are different decisions and
  ADR-2608039970 makes opposite calls on them.

  ### Why the access paths are re-exported rather than pointed at

  `arrangement.core` already exports these four (they are `datalog.index`'s,
  re-exported there). Those take no `visible?` -- they are raw index reads.
  Re-exporting them here is what puts the ADR-2607050500 discipline on the
  supported path: a surface that reaches past this namespace into
  `arrangement.core/entity-attrs` is not doing something faster, it is doing
  something with no visibility decision in it. This repo's own tests did
  exactly that before ADR-2608039970, which is how it was noticed.

  Filtering also PRUNES: an attribute whose every value is invisible is
  dropped from the returned map rather than left as an empty set. An empty
  set under a key would tell the caller the attribute exists while hiding
  what it holds, which is the leak `visible?` exists to prevent.

  ### `refs-to` is empty for most materialized dbs, and that is not a bug

  `:ocp` is populated only for objects satisfying the `ref?` predicate
  `materialize` asserts with, which is `arrangement.core`'s default,
  `ipld.core/link?`. Documents materialized here carry plain EDN values, so
  in practice nothing lands in `:ocp` and `refs-to` returns `{}`. The
  reverse lookup a surface actually wants -- \"who points at this key?\" -- is
  `by-predicate-value`, since a foreign key here is a VALUE (`:dept-key
  \"d1\"`), not an IPLD link. See the worked join example above.

  Making `ref?` injectable so a surface could declare its own reference
  attributes is a real follow-up, and it is not free: `materialize-memo`'s
  key would have to cover it, and a function is not a memo key. A
  declarative `:ref-attrs #{...}` set would be, which is the shape to reach
  for if this is ever needed.

  ## A note on `kqe`

  ADR-2607172300's dependency table names `kotoba-lang/kqe` alongside
  `kotoba-lang/arrangement`. As of this repo's landing, `kqe` is RETIRED --
  its content (`[s p o]` pattern routing) was merged into `arrangement` as
  `arrangement.query`, and the actual Datomic-shaped `:find`/`:where`
  Datalog engine (`arrangement.datalog/q`, used here) lives in `arrangement`
  too and never existed in `kqe` at all. This bridge therefore depends on
  `kotoba-lang/arrangement` only -- see `kqe`'s README (\"this repo is
  retired\") and `arrangement`'s own README/ADR-2607050700 for the merge."

(defn- ->attr
  "A document key -> the datom attribute for it.

  Documents arrive with BOTH key types and this is not a corner case:
  `kotobase.protocols.atproto` stores the record it parsed out of a JSON
  body verbatim, so its keys are strings, while every document written from
  Clojure (and every test in this repo) has keyword keys. Left alone, the
  same field is two different attributes depending on how it was written.

  That broke both query surfaces at once, in the two worst ways available:

    - SPARQL 500s. `kotobase.protocols.sparql.quads/kw->iri-string` calls
      `namespace`, which in ClojureScript throws `Doesn't support namespace:
      <x>` on a string. Every SPARQL query against such a graph failed,
      whatever the query said. Found in production 2026-07-31, where the
      surface had been answering 200 on /health the whole time.
    - Cypher silently returns nothing. `n.text` translates to the keyword
      `:text`, which never matches the string attribute `\"text\"`, so the
      answer is an empty result set rather than an error.

  Normalising here rather than in each surface is what makes those two
  agree: the bridge is where a document becomes datoms, and a datom
  attribute should have one type. `(keyword \"a/b\")` splits on the slash
  into `:a/b`, which is what the IRI form and the Cypher form both already
  render as `a/b`, so the round trip holds."
